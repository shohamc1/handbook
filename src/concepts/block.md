# Blocks and the Blockchain

Each DeFiChain block consists of

- a block header: contains metadata about the block and its contents and links to previous block
- a body: contains a list of transactions in that block.

Blocks are identified by their [SHA256 hashes](./glossary.md#hashing).

## Block header

The header format of DeFiChain blocks is as follows. The implementation of the block header can be found in the class `CBlockHeader` in file [`src/primitives/block.h`](https://github.com/DeFiCh/ain/blob/master/src/primitives/block.h#L23).

## Block Body

The block body consists of

- a list of pointers which map to transactions
- a local variable `fChecked` (not shared between nodes) to track if the block has been successfully validated previously

The list of transactions has type `vector<CTransactionRef>`, and each `CTransactionRef` points to a [`CTransaction`](https://github.com/DeFiCh/ain/blob/master/src/primitives/transaction.h#L210). The contents of each Transaction as well as the different types of Transactions are detailed in the [Transactions document](./transaction.md).
